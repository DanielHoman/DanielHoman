### 📱 Flutter Projects (Learning-Based)

These projects were built as part of my structured Flutter learning journey, showcasing key Flutter concepts in practice:

* **Knight Duel (Web Demo Available):** A self-developed, turn-based strategy board game demonstrating complex **Game Logic / State Machines** (using Riverpod), **Responsive UI** for various screen sizes, multi-language **Localization**, and basic **AI Development**. Demo Link: [danielhoman.github.io/knight_duel](https://danielhoman.github.io/knight_duel/)

* **Real-Time Chat Application:** Focus on **real-time backend integration** using **Firebase (Firestore, Auth, FCM)**. Mastered asynchronous data handling via **Riverpod StreamProvider** and implemented **Push Notifications**.
* **Favorite Places App:** Camera + GPS integration (native features), **local SQLite database**, and **Riverpod** state management.
* **Meals App:** Complex **multi-screen navigation** (Drawer / Tabs) and **app-wide state management** using Riverpod.
* **Shopping List App:** **HTTP CRUD operations**, JSON serialization, and **asynchronous data handling** with backend communication.
* **Expense Tracker:** **Responsive UI** for portrait/landscape modes with **chart-based data visualization**.

### 🎮 Logical & Problem-Solving Skills

My games made with **Godot Engine** and **Flutter** demonstrate strong logical thinking and algorithmic experimentation:

* **Knight Duel (Flutter/Dart):** Complex implementation of a **turn-based game logic** with a two-phase strategic flow and basic **score-based AI opponent**.
* **BattleLeap (WIP):** Tactical 2D platformer with local **2–4 player multiplayer** and complex game state handling.
* **Sudoku:** Classic logic game with **algorithmic puzzle generation** and error highlighting.
* **Minesweeper:** Classic logic game with randomized board generation.
* **TicTacToe:** Simple **AI (bot opponent)** implementation inside the game.
